<h1 align="center">Hi, I’m Aditya - currently starring in *“It worked on my machine.”*</h1>
<p align="center">
  I think in systems, explain in metaphors, and live for those *“ohhh, <strong>now</strong> I get it!”* moments.
</p>

I’m deeply into machine learning - not just building models, but obsessively trying to **understand** them.

Like, why is the optimizer behaving like a toddler on sugar? What do gradients *really* want? These are the mysteries I wake up for.

I’m the kind of person who won’t sleep until I can explain backpropagation to a potato.

Clarity isn’t a nice-to-have - it’s a personal vendetta.

If it’s not intuitive, I’ll keep poking it with a stick until it is.

I don’t chase hype. I chase “aha!” moments.

I like taking big, scary-sounding concepts - like softmax or vector spaces - and turning them into something your cousin who just learned what a matrix is can understand (and maybe even enjoy?).

I value learning over lingo, clean ideas over clever hacks, and curiosity over credentials.

Not here to flex. Here to untangle the spaghetti.

Whether I’m writing code, breaking my mental model (again), or helping someone else go from “huh?” to “heck yeah,”

I’m always guided by one golden question:

> 💭 “How do I make this click for someone who’s never seen it before?”

That’s what I care about.

That’s what I do.

Also, I sometimes debug by staring at the screen until the code feels guilty enough to fix itself.
