<h1 align="center">Heya! I'm Aditya Pande 👋</h1>
I think in systems, speak in metaphors, and live for those “ohhh, now it makes sense” moments.<br><br>I’m passionate about machine learning, not just building with it, but truly understanding it. I believe the real magic happens when you can take something complex like gradients, optimization, abstraction and explain it so clearly that even someone just learning matrices can feel the spark.<br><br>For me, clarity isn’t optional. It’s the goal.<br>I don’t chase complexity for the sake of it. I dig deep, break things apart, and rebuild them until they feel intuitive, not just to me, but to anyone curious enough to follow along.<br><br>I value learning over buzzwords, ideas over trends, and clean thinking over clever hacks. I’m not here to show off, I’m here to make sense of the mess, one concept at a time.<br><br>Whether I’m writing code, debugging a mental model, or helping someone else see the bigger picture, I’m always trying to answer the same question:<br>“How do I make this click for someone who’s never seen it before?”<br><br>That’s what drives me. That’s what I do best.
