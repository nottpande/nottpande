  I think in systems, speak in metaphors, and live for those <em>“ohhh, <strong>now</strong> it makes sense”</em> moments.
</p>

I’m passionate about machine learning — not just building with it, but truly understanding it.  
I believe the real magic happens when you can take something complex — gradients, optimization, abstraction — and explain it so clearly that even someone who just learned matrices can feel the spark.

For me, clarity isn’t optional. It’s the goal.  
I don’t chase complexity for the sake of it. I dig deep, break things apart, and rebuild them until they feel intuitive — not just to me, but to anyone curious enough to follow along.

I value learning over buzzwords, ideas over trends, and clean thinking over clever hacks.  
I’m not here to show off — I’m here to make sense of the mess, one concept at a time.

Whether I’m writing code, debugging a mental model, or helping someone else see the bigger picture,  
I’m always asking myself the same question:  
> 💭 **“How do I make this *click* for someone who’s never seen it before?”**

That’s what drives me.  
That’s what I do best.
